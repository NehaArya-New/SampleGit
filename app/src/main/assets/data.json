	"description": "64 (2048) is a single-player puzzle game created in March 2014 by 19-year-old Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli, in which the objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.",
	"instructions": "64 (2048) is played on a gray 4x4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide smoothly when a player moves them using the lefft, right, up, or down swipes.<br/><br/> Every turn, a new tile will randomly appear in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4. Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid.<br/><br/> If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided. The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move.<br/><br/>  Win by making the tile with 64!"
